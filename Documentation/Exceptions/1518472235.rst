   ====================================

   Situation
   ---------

   Describe everything to understand the situation: Systems, environment, versions.
   What happened?

   Solution
   --------

   1. Check your Config for old user_functions
   In a specific case, there was this problem. It happened after an Upgrade from V7 to V9 and has something to do with 404 handling.
   Back in the days there was a way to make your own 404 handling by creating an user_function. In this case it was "PageNotFoundHandling"
   If the extension, that handles it is not persistent anymore, simply remove it from your LocalConfiguration.php
   
   'FE'=>'pageNotFound_handling' => 'USER_FUNCTION:typo3conf/ext/xyz/PageNotFoundHandling.php:user_pageNotFound->pageNotFound',
   
   If removed, the normal PageNotFoundHandling will be enabled and you can use the Siteconfiguration to customize it.
